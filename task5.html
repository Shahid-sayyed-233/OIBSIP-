        <h1>A  Nikola Tesla</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The Genius Who Illuminated the World</p>

        <p>
            **Nikola Tesla** (1856 – 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply system. His radical ideas and prophetic vision of technology often placed him far ahead of his time.
        </p>

        <h2>The War of Currents and AC Power</h2>
        <p>
            Tesla's most significant contribution was his work on **Alternating Current (AC)**. While working for Thomas Edison, who championed direct current (DC), Tesla recognized the superior efficiency of AC for long-distance power transmission. This led to the famous "War of Currents" where Tesla, backed by George Westinghouse, ultimately prevailed, paving the way for the global electrification of the planet.
        </p>

        <h2>Major Inventions and Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            Tesla's professional life was defined by his relentless pursuit of innovation, resulting in hundreds of patents. His most notable achievements include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**The AC Induction Motor:** The foundation of all modern motor systems used in industry and homes worldwide.</li>
            <li>**The Tesla Coil:** An apparatus used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency AC electricity.</li>
            <li>**Radio Technology:** Tesla demonstrated the principles of radio transmission before Marconi, though Marconi received the initial patent recognition. The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld Tesla's patent priority.</li>
            <li>**Remote Control:** He successfully demonstrated a radio-controlled boat in 1898, a revolutionary step toward modern robotics and drone technology.</li>
            <li>**Wireless Energy Transfer (The Wardenclyffe Tower):** Though unfinished, this project aimed to transmit electrical energy and communications wirelessly across the Atlantic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tesla's Enduring Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            What is most compelling about Tesla is his sheer **visionary foresight**. He accurately predicted technologies such as smartphones, wireless internet, and drone warfare over a century ago. Despite facing financial difficulties and often being marginalized by contemporaries, his genius fundamentally changed the technological course of the 20th century and continues to inspire engineers today. The unit of magnetic flux density is officially named the **tesla (T)** in his honor.
